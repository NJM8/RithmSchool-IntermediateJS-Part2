What is XHR?
	XHR stands for XML Http Request. It is an api that allows data transfer between client and server, it can only be used with JS and allows the response to be received without refreshing the page.

What is XML? Why do we prefer to use JSON?
	XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. JSON is more preferable because it is faster, less verbose, and more restrictive which leads to greater readability and ease of intrepretation.

What is AJAX?
	Asychronous Javascript and XML. A set of technologies that allows for a page to make a change to on screen data without refreshing the whole page.
